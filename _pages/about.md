Thanks for visiting my personal promotion platform! 

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fwllow**  in the <span style ="color:blue">[Systems Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)</span>, <span style = "color:blue">[Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics](https://medschool.umich.edu/departments/computational-medicine-bioinformatics)</span>,  <span style = "color:blue">[Michigan Medicine](https://www.uofmhealth.org/)</span>, <span style = "color:blue">[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA](https://umich.edu/)</span>, being mentored by <span style ="color:blue">[Arvind Rao, PhD](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/rao-arvind.html)</span>. I earned my _Ph.D._ in _Biostatistics_ from <span style ="color:blue">[University of Louisville; KY, USA](https://louisville.edu/)</span> in Fall 2022, under the joint supervision of <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span>. 

My research portfolio is anchored in Bayesian frameworks, addressing methods for Undirected Graph construction, High-Dim Graphical Models, as well as practical methodologies for Sparse Network Estimation and Bayesian Variable Selection within Hierarchical Models. I've been trying to venture into the realms of Spatial Statistics, Functional Data Analysis and Variational Bayes Algorithms for scalability in biomedical imaging incorporating innovative computational methods for complex data in a field that demands precision and efficiency.

Currenly, I am being trained in advanced bioinformatic tools and biostatistical methods for cancer research through numerous next-gen sequencing and biomedical imaging technologies like Multiplex-Immunoprofiling (mIF), Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
