Thanks for visiting my personal promotion platform! 

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow**  in the <span style ="color:blue">[Systems Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)</span>, <span style = "color:blue">[Gilbert S. Omenn Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics](https://medschool.umich.edu/departments/computational-medicine-bioinformatics)</span>,  <span style = "color:blue">[Michigan Medicine](https://www.uofmhealth.org/)</span>, <span style = "color:blue">[University of Michigan; Ann Arbor, MI, USA](https://umich.edu/)</span>, being mentored by <span style ="color:blue">[Arvind Rao, PhD](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/rao-arvind.html)</span>. I earned my _Ph.D._ in _Biostatistics_ from <span style ="color:blue">[University of Louisville; KY, USA](https://louisville.edu/)</span> in Fall 2022, under the joint supervision of <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span>. 

My research portfolio is anchored in Bayesian frameworks addressing Graphical Models for Sparse Network Estimation. I have been working on algorithms for scalability in biomedical imaging incorporating innovative computational methods for complex data in an area that demands precision and efficiency.

Currenly, I am being trained in advanced bioinformatic tools for cancer research through next-gen sequencing and biomedical imaging technologies like Multiplex-Immunoprofiling (mIF).
